   <b> About me:</b>
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    My name is Cameron Redgrave, I am a 27 year old who resides in Melbourne,
    Australia. I was born in Australia but also hold a citizenship in
    England/the U.K.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I currently hold a Certificate IV in photoimaging and photography is a
    passion of mine. In particular I enjoy the craft of 35mm film photography.
    I also enjoy watching football and cricket in my spare time.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    My interest in IT was started from a very young age, exposure to online
    gaming sparked a curiosity about dial-up internet and networking in
    general. From here my passion grew, eventually leading me to accept an IT
    infrastructure role, working for a private health fund based in Melbourne.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I have chosen to study at RMIT for a number of reasons. The first is the
    exemplary reputation of the Information Technology department. And most
    importantly, for my own knowledge and personal development.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I am expecting and hoping to develop both my technical and professional
    skills to not only increase chances of future employment, but to hopefully
    lead my own team or my own passion projects down the line.

  <b>  My Ideal Job:</b>
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Below is a link to a job which I think is similar to where I want to end up
    in the future:

    This job advertisement is for a role of a Systems and Administrator. To me,
    this IT Administration role will provide the delivery and support of
    Information Technology used by all functional areas of the business. I
    believe the role would also involve monitoring and where appropriate
    initiate, introduce or modify operating procedures when core system
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    modifications, enhancements or changes are implemented. This role appeals
    to me because of the high level technical skills required to manage the
    systems and networks involved.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    This role will require a vast array of skills and qualifications. As well
    as the 5 years experience needed to apply, I would also require the ability
    to monitor key systems and respond as required, i.e.: network, servers,
    power, websites and storage. Along with these requirements, it sounds like
    I would require a number of technical qualifications, including the ones
    listed as well as Industry Certifications i.e. VCP, MCSA, CCNA, ITIL,etc. I
    will need to have completed a Tertiary qualification in a relevant area
    i.e. Information Technology, Business Information Systems, Computer
    Science.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I currently hold a position in IT with almost 6 months experience now.
    Through this role I have
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    demonstrated knowledge and experience in Microsoft packages including
    Active Directory, IIS, DNS, SQL Server, Windows Server, Exchange Server. I
    have also had to demonstrate knowledge and experience working in a virtual
    environment. As well as demonstrate knowledge and experience in network
    configuration i.e. VLAN’s, ACL’s, routing, etc. Although I currently don’t
    have any relevant tertiary education.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    To gain the necessary skills to apply for such a role, there are two key
    components in my mind. The first, is experience. I will need to continue to
    gain experience in a role similar to the one advertised, or perhaps at a
    slightly lower level. The second would the tertiary education. Along with a
    University degree, I would require the necessary Industry Certificates.
    Which can often be gained through an employer. I am planning on using
    upskilling and development programs though my employer to obtain these
    certs.

   <b> Personal Profile:</b>
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Below are the results of a learning styles test, a 16 personality test
    (Myers-Briggs) and a brain colour test for myself.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I think these results show that I would make a great listener in a team
    environment, I would be able to successfully hear ideas and listen to
    everyone's views. These tests also reflect that I may get caught up with
    big picture ideas and that could potentially be a negative thing.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    In terms of forming a team, this could be paired with people who are more
    technical or who are visual learners. I think that these results affirm
    that I am a creative person, so it could be paired with those who are able
    to focus on the smaller parts of a project and task.

    My Project:
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    My dream project is a website and companion mobile app for wine and wine
    tasting. The vision is an app and website in which you could search for any
    type of wine and be able to find any details about it and reference lots of
    information about the chosen product.. A common problem, at least amongst
    consumers, is that it can be extremely difficult to find a product which
    suits your taste without tasting a wine or just by reading the label.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a former hospitality worker, I believe there would absolutely be a
    market for such a product. I have seen first hand the vigour and passion
    for wine and have experienced wine tasting courses and sessions related to
    wine making. My project could not only be used by the casual wine drinker,
    but enthusiasts and winemakers alike. Wine sales generated approximately
    $6.25bn in sales in the 2017-18 financial year, with 852m litres being
    exported1. I believe that this idea has the potential to be of great
    benefit to wine producers, merchants and consumers alike.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The project will be scoped in two stages. Firstly, a website with multiple
    features and functions. It would act as a massive database for wines,
    vinyards and winemakers. This database could be searched in a number of
    ways, using multiple different filters. Once a wine is selected, a profile
    of the chosen product would appear, with a plethora of information about
    it. This would include region and grape information, locations of where to
    buy the wine, pricing, detailed information about each vintage and
    extensive tasting notes. The profile would also suggest food and wine
    pairings, similar wines and could even offer selections based on your
    previous choices. Further to this, a user’s taste profile could be mapped
    and stored for more suggestions. The focus of this website would be ease of
    navigation and clean, simple designs. The site must be extremely
    approachable for all users.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Secondly, a fully integrated mobile phone app for iOS and Android devices.
    Your profile would transition from the web to mobile platform easily,
    remembering all saved wines and recently viewed items. Eventually, with
    enough industry support, we could launch a feature that could scan QR codes
    on bottles of wine and provide instant tasting notes. Again, the focus of
    the development would be centred around the UX design, with customer
    navigation and ease of use being top priorities.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In terms of a technical perspective, the website would require a
    development suite. Perhaps something like WordPress, or Java. Perhaps even
    ASP which could be paired with Umbraco. For the web databases, servers
    would be required. Virtual Machines could be built if necessary, or a
    platform such as Microsoft Azure. The web servers would require security,
    firewalls, and the website itself would require an SSL encryption and DDOS
    protection. Android development is open-source, with many API options but
    the iOS development suite would need to be purchased.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    A team of developers would be required for both the deployment of the web
    platform, as well as the later mobile iterations. A UX designer or web
    designer could be used also, to aid in the customer journey and user
    experience. While the physical servers could be managed off site, through a
    vendor, a Sys Admin or Network Engineer could be employed to assist in the
    implementation of the cloud/VMs.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    If the project is successful, the website and app could have a large impact
    both on wine culture, but consumer choice in the wine industry. Enabling
    consumers to make more empowered choices when it comes to drinking wine and
    enjoying themselves.
